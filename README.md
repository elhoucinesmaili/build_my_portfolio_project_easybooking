## Optional: Adding a Personal & Technical Touch

### My Journey & Motivation
As a solo developer passionate about travel technology, I wanted to build a booking platform with a more intuitive user experience. My inspiration came from a frustrating experience while traveling, where I found it difficult to find affordable last-minute accommodations.
